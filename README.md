# News Corpus Builder 3k

This is a package that can be used to quickly build a corpus from news articles. 

**Originally written by https://github.com/skillachie, I've modified it to work with Python 3.x.**

To install:

```pip install git+git://github.com/yhbk12/news-corpus-builder.git```

The usage remains the same. See http://skillachie.github.io/news-corpus-builder/ for instructions.
